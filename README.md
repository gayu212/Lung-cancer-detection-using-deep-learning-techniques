# Lung-cancer-detection-using-deep-learning-techniques
The data input for the project is CT Scan images and they were preprocessed and then the features are extracted using Convolutional neural networks and the model is trained using five deep learning models like CNN,VGG16,MOBILENET,INCEPTION and RESNET.Then these models are evaluated using performance metrics
